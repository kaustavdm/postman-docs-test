# what is pro

Postman's vision is to help you build a super fast and smooth workflow for API development keeping some key questions in mind:

* Where are my APIs and do I know how they are changing?
* Are they documented properly?
* How do I follow an agile process to test them?
* Are they working properly all the time?
* Can I connect all my tools with my API development workflow?

Postman Pro offers solutions that satisfy each of the questions above.

* Postman now enables [API design](postman/design_and_develop_apis/introduction_to_apis.md) directly within Postman, making API creation better and faster.
* Collaboration with Personal and Team [Workspaces](postman/workspaces/intro_to_workspaces.md).
* [API documentation](postman/api_documentation/intro_to_api_documentation.md) to generate beautiful, machine-readable documentation for your API, and automatically keep it up to date.
* Create a single source of truth for your APIs with common [schemas](https://github.com/kaustavdm/postman-docs-test/tree/b9c2cefa916197b408de633b2ecb1d256acf0a06/docs/postman/design_and_develop_apis/the_api_workflow/README.md#creating-a-new-schema) and [versioning tools](postman/design_and_develop_apis/versioning_an_api.md).
* Powerful [mock servers](postman/mock_servers/intro_to_mock_servers.md) to simulate the real API and decouple teams.
* Collection [monitoring](postman/monitors/intro_monitors.md) to check for the performance, uptime and correctness of your API.
* [Out-of-the-box integrations](postman_pro/integrations/intro_integrations.md) and the [Postman API](postman/postman_api/intro_api.md) to connect your different tools.
* Adding and verifying [custom domains](postman/api_documentation/adding_and_verifying_custom_domains.md)
