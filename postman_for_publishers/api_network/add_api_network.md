The Postman API Network provides the most trustworthy and easy-to-use directory of public APIs available. Every API listed in this network includes a complete Postman collection, created by the API's publisher. Postman specifically designed the API network to onboard developers quickly and effectively.

**Note:**  Organizations that develop APIs for consumers can publish their APIs in the API network. Published APIs will be listed in the team profile page.

### How to add APIs to API Network

While publishing your collection to the API network, ensure your API has an API name, summary, description. Verify your team name, logo, and team description. Select the categories that best describe your API and service.

Once submitted, the Postman team will review the submission for approval, and then your API will be accessible to millions of developers worldwide.
