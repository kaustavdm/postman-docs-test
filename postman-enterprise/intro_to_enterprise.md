# intro to enterprise

Postman helps Enterprise users build an API development workflow that monitors the health and status of APIs, produces quality documentation, connects to third party tools for API development, and implements an agile process to test APIs.

Postman provides Enterprise users with:

* Single Sign-On \(SSO\): Access to the company’s Postman instance based on the customer’s existing identity management workflow. Postman Enterprise currently supports multiple SSO providers – Okta, OneLogin, Duo, Ping Identity, AD FS, and GSuite. Postman provides SAML 2.0-compliant identity provider support.
* Audit logs: Ability to track activities within a team. Postman Enterprise users can use audit logs to review changes in team management, billing, and security settings.
* Static IP for Monitoring: Customers can use the static IP feature to use Postman monitoring, while complying with their company’s security policy. This enterprise-only feature allows customers to test IPs securely behind a firewall, by whitelisting a single static IP address to use for monitoring.
* Extended support and billing: Dedicated support, onboarding and billing options for larger organizations, and provisioning.

In addition to SSO, audit logs, static IP, and extended support and billing, the Enterprise plan shares Postman Pro features, such as:

* [Dedicated IP addresses](https://github.com/kaustavdm/postman-docs-test/tree/b9c2cefa916197b408de633b2ecb1d256acf0a06/docs/postman/monitors/intro_monitors/README.md#monitoring-resources-in-multiple-regions) for API monitoring.
* [Monitoring](/postman/monitors/intro_monitors.md) to check the performance of your API. Postman monitoring lets you run a collection periodically to check for its performance and response. You can set up a monitor to run as frequently as 5 minutes.
* [Mock servers](/postman/mock_servers/intro_to_mock_servers.md) to simulate the real API and decouple teams collection [monitoring](/postman/monitors/intro_monitors.md) to check the performance of your API. Decoupling enables different members of your development team to work in parallel rather than having to wait on different pieces to be built before moving forward.
* [Out-of-the-box integrations](/postman_pro/integrations/intro_integrations.md) and the [Postman API](/postman/postman_api/intro_api.md) to connect your different tools.
