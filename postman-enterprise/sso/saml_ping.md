# saml ping

_Note: only an admin of your Ping Identity organization can create the application._

## Setting up a custom SAML application in Ping Identity

1. From the Ping Identity admin console, select the **Applications** tab. ![ping\_app](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/ping_app)
2. Under the **My Applications** tab, find the **Add Application** dropdown and select **New SAML Application**. ![ping\_new\_SAML](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/ping_new_SAML)
3. Fill in the required application details and continue to the next step. ![ping\_details](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/ping_details)
4. Download the **SAML metadata** file, and enter your Postman service provider details. These details can be found on the Postman [Edit Team Details page](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general).

   | **Field** | **Value** |
   | :--- | :--- |
   | Protocol Version | SAML v 2.0 |
   | Assertion Consumer Service | _collect it from the Postman team details page_ |
   | Entity ID | _collect it from the Postman team details page_ |

   Leave the remaining fields blank or with the default value, and continue to the next step. ![ping service provider](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/ping_service_provider)

5. Add **email** as an application attribute and map it to **Email**. Click **Save & Publish**. ![ping email](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/ping_email)
6. After configuring all the details, enable the new SAML application with the **Enable** toggle. ![ping toggle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/ping_toggle)
7. Once enabled, the status will show as **Active** for the application. ![ping active](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/ping_active)
8. Once the setup is completed, submit your Identity Provider's details to Postman. Copy the `Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL`, `Identity Provider Issuer`, and `X.509 Certificate` from the downloaded **SAML metadata** file and enter these values on the Postman [Edit Team Details page](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general) within the **Ping Identity Provider Details** modal.
