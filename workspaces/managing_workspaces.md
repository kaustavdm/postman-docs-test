# managing\_workspaces

You can manage workspaces and the Postman elements associated with a workspace, like [collections](https://github.com/kaustavdm/postman-docs-test/tree/b9c2cefa916197b408de633b2ecb1d256acf0a06/docs/postman/collections/intro_to_collections/README.md), [environments](https://github.com/kaustavdm/postman-docs-test/tree/b9c2cefa916197b408de633b2ecb1d256acf0a06/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/intro_to_environments_and_globals/README.md), [mocks](https://github.com/kaustavdm/postman-docs-test/tree/b9c2cefa916197b408de633b2ecb1d256acf0a06/docs/postman/mock_servers/intro_to_mock_servers/README.md), [monitors](https://github.com/kaustavdm/postman-docs-test/tree/b9c2cefa916197b408de633b2ecb1d256acf0a06/docs/postman/monitors/intro_monitors/README.md), and more.

### Collections

You can share a collection to multiple workspaces.

### Environments

Add an existing environment to this workspace or [create a new environment](https://github.com/kaustavdm/postman-docs-test/tree/b9c2cefa916197b408de633b2ecb1d256acf0a06/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/manage_environments/README.md). You can share an environment to multiple workspaces.

### Monitors

[Create a monitor](https://github.com/kaustavdm/postman-docs-test/tree/b9c2cefa916197b408de633b2ecb1d256acf0a06/docs/postman/monitors/setting_up_monitor/README.md) to track the performance of your APIs in a workspace. A monitor created within a workspace cannot be shared to other workspaces. If you want to create a monitor with a collection that is shared in multiple workspaces, a new monitor must be created in each of the other workspaces.

### Mocks

[Create a mock server](https://github.com/kaustavdm/postman-docs-test/tree/b9c2cefa916197b408de633b2ecb1d256acf0a06/docs/postman/mock_servers/setting_up_mock/README.md) to simulate a server response. A mock created within a workspace cannot be shared to other workspaces. If you want to create a mock with a collection that is shared in multiple workspaces, a new mock must be created in each of the other workspaces.

### Integrations

View a list of current integrations or create a new one. Postman has [third party integrations](https://github.com/kaustavdm/postman-docs-test/tree/b9c2cefa916197b408de633b2ecb1d256acf0a06/docs/postman_pro/integrations/intro_integrations/README.md) available to help you integrate with your existing workflow and tools. Integrations created within a workspace cannot be shared to other workspaces. If you want to create an integration with a collection that is shared in multiple workspaces, a new integration must be created in each of the other workspaces.

### Activity
